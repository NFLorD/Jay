  - Improved significantly dumper.php, trying to replicate what var_dumper is doing.  
  - Couldn't manage to have the dropdowns close on click.

  - Managed to have the dropdowns close on click. I was removing the class before using .toggle(), thus was always adding it.  
  - Replicated the maker's make:entity. Very basic for now. No objects relations handling.  
  - It makes classes, properties, getters and setters.  
  
Mon, 23rd of December, 2019:  
  - Added .gitignore  
  - Changed routing: added parameter injection  

Sat, 28th of December, 2019:
  - Made subdirectories possible in the controllers directory
  - Made it so controllers themselves can have a route (thus all their method routes have a prefix)
  - Started working on the front-end framework again
  - This code is feeling familiar again, improved it slightly
